<h3>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</h3> 
<p>The main purpose of this project is to analyze text records, to list items purchased from user input and to list items purchased in chronological order by displaying text-based histogram. To summarize, this project is all about file manipulation while integrating Python with C++.</p>

<h3>What did you do particularly well?</h3>
<p>I would say the menu display with switch and while loop in C++, as well as the file manipulation in Python </p> 

<h3>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? </h3>
<p>Since we have only two weeks to understand the integration between C++ and Python, I would say I need to spend more time practicing these integration in order to avoid reading violation when compiling the code. My improvements would be fixing my user validate input and rearrange the code structure to improve readability.</p>

<h3>Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?</h3>
<p>I guess it's the time when I stuck with file manipulation in Python segments, because every time I compiled, the result always be reading violation which was very frustrated to me at that time. I think I lost count of how many time I got that error. But after maybe a hundred tab of python guide on youtube and stack overflow, I got it to work evetually</p>

<h3>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? </h3>
<p>I think it's the critical thinking skills because you need to comprehend project requirement in order to solve the problem </p>

<h3>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </h3>
<p>Following programing style guideline should be priority number one, understanding the project requirement and following the project standards would be second. Combined them together, we will have a maintainable, readable and adaptable program.</p>
